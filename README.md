## Introduction

sBPF is a subset of the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) tailored for the Solana blockchain, enabling the creation of efficient, low-level programs that interact with Solana's runtime. Whether you're developing smart contracts, optimizing performance, or exploring system-level programming on Solana, understanding sBPF assembly is crucial.

This cheatsheet repository provides annotated examples of common sBPF assembly instructions, register usage conventions, control flow mechanisms, and a comprehensive list of syscalls. It's an invaluable resource for both beginners and seasoned developers looking to deepen their understanding of sBPF programming.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Assembly Examples:** Detailed sBPF assembly code snippets covering arithmetic operations, register conventions, control flow, and syscalls.
- **Annotated Code:** Extensive comments and explanations within the assembly files to facilitate learning and reference.
- **Automated Testing:** Rust-based tests to ensure the correctness of assembly programs using the `sbpf` tool.
- **Syscall Reference:** A complete list of sBPF syscalls with descriptions, implemented in `syscalls.s`.
- **Public Repository:** Open for personal reference and community contributions, serving as a collaborative learning tool.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the sBPF assembly programs, ensure you have the following tools and dependencies installed:

1. **Solana Development Environment:** The Solana tool suite is required for building, deploying, and interacting with Solana programs.

2. **Solana Tool Suite:** Necessary for interacting with the Solana blockchain and deploying programs.

   - Install via [Solana's installation guide](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools):
     ```sh
     sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/stable/install)"
     ```

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several key assembly files, each focusing on different aspects of sBPF programming:

# Running Tests

Automated tests ensure that the assembly programs function as expected. The tests are written in Rust and utilize the `sbpf` tool to build and execute the assembly code.

### Test Structure

The Rust test module is located in `src/lib.rs` and includes tests for each assembly program:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use mollusk_svm::{result::Check, Mollusk};
    use solana_sdk::{instruction::Instruction, pubkey::Pubkey};
    use std::path::Path;

    /// Helper function to run a test for a given program.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `program` - The name of the program to test (e.g., "registers", "arithmetic", "control_flow", "syscalls").
    fn run_test(program: &str) {
        let keypair_path = format!("deploy/{}-keypair.json", program);
        assert!(
            Path::new(&keypair_path).exists(),
            "Keypair file does not exist: {}",
            keypair_path
        );

        let program_id_keypair_bytes = std::fs::read(&keypair_path)
            .expect("Failed to read keypair file")
            .get(..32)
            .expect("Keypair file is too short")
            .try_into()
            .expect("Slice with incorrect length");
        let program_id = Pubkey::new_from_array(program_id_keypair_bytes);
        let instruction = Instruction::new_with_bytes(program_id, &[], vec![]);
        let deploy_path = format!("deploy/{}", program);
        assert!(
            Path::new(&(deploy_path.clone() + ".so")).exists(),
            "Deploy path does not exist: {}",
            deploy_path
        );

        let mollusk = Mollusk::new(&program_id, &deploy_path);

        let result =
            mollusk.process_and_validate_instruction(&instruction, &[], &[Check::success()]);

        assert!(
            !result.program_result.is_err(),
            "Program execution failed: {:?}",
            result.program_result
        );
    }

    #[test]
    fn registers() {
        run_test("registers");
    }

    #[test]
    fn arithmetic() {
        run_test("arithmetic");
    }

    #[test]
    fn control_flow() {
        run_test("control_flow");
    }

    #[test]
    fn syscalls() {
        run_test("syscalls");
    }
}
```
